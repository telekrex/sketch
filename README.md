## About
I originally created this game to be printed on paper and the players use dice to decide the drawing prompt. Since I used Python to test it when I was settling on the design, I've since decided to clean it up and upload it, maybe someone will think it's fun. The following is the instructions, translated from the print-out version to virtual. You'll have to run it as a Python script, I didn't think packaging was necessary. This is a completed project and was just for fun - I don't expect contributions, but I'd welcome any ideas so discussions are open.

## Pre-Requisites
- Python 3
- (Optional) a text editor

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. (Optional) Edit the files under `/contents` to add or remove things to the game.

## How it Works:
Number of players: **1+**  
Objective: **Try to draw ideas generated by the script**

An idea will be a combination of a **subject(s)**, a **modifier**, **an action**, and an **environment**.

The `/contents` folder contains files with lists of possibilities. There's a ton of content already here, but I encourage you to add more of your own. Just be sure to go along with the example content's format and use case. If you're unsure, think like this:

- *Subject(s)* will be a character, a thing, or idea.
- *Modifiers* will describe the subject; sometimes physical, sometimes a trait, sometimes a mood.
- *Actions* will be something for your subject to be doing.
- *Environments* [self explanatory] are the surroundings for your subject to be in.

## Play
To generate an idea, run the file `draw_this.py` in a terminal of your choice from the directory its in with the `/contents` folder. The script will print an idea for you in the terminal, now try to draw it!

Sometimes the generated idea won't make sense - that's okay. It's up to you to get creative and make it happen.
