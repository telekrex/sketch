# Draw This
First Edition (June 2023)

### About
I originally created this game to be printed on paper and the players use dice to decide the drawing prompt. Since I used Python to test it when I was settling on the design, I've since decided to clean it up and upload it, maybe someone will think it's fun. The following is the instructions, translated from the print-out version to virtual. You'll have to run it as a Python script, I didn't think packaging was necessary.

## Number of players:
1+

## Objective:
Generate an idea, then try to draw it!

## How it works:
An idea will be a combination of a **subject(s)**, a **modifier**, **an action**, and an **environment**.

The `/contents` folder contains files [with a corresponding title] with lists of examples. There's a ton of content already here, but if you want, I encourage you to add more of your own. Just be sure to keep any additions similar in use case to the existing examples. You'll want them to fit nicely into the generated ideas.

- *Subject(s)* will be a character, a thing, or idea.
- *Modifiers* will describe the subject; sometimes physical, sometimes a trait, sometimes a mood.
- *Actions* will be something for your subject to be doing.
- *Environments* [self explanatory] are the surroundings for your subject to be in.

To generate an idea, run the file `draw-this.py` in a terminal of your choice. The script will print an idea for you in the terminal, now try to draw it! It's okay if the idea doesn't make sense, it's up to you to get creative and make it happen.

With the lists included in this edition, there are *104,000,000* possibilities!
